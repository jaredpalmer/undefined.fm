            conversations with world-class engineers about software development.

            a podcast for the industry insiders by industry insiders. About Our
            Hosts... Both Jared and Ken are prolific in the open source
            enthusiasts and each has created some of the most popular frontend
            libraries and fullstack development tools in the world.

                is great because it feels less like a ‚Äúprogramming podcast‚Äù and
                more like a couple of buds shooting the shit, and they happen to

              numbers are hard to get, here are a few bits of info about our
              audience that should give you an idea of who is listening:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The geographic makeup of the audience consists of 45% USA, 8%

                2% Norway, 2% Poland, 2% Netherlands. The rest of the audience
                is fairly well distributed between the rest of Europe, Brazil,
                and India.
              </li>

                Of those who listen on phones, it's roughly 80% iPhone users and

                According to Twitter Analytics, 54% of our audience has a

              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Audience Interests</h2>
            <p>
              The Undefined.fm audience is primarily advanced software
              developers. In fact, we consciously do not cater to entry-level
              developers, as there are lots of other podcasts that focus on that
              audience. Instead, we approach each show as a peer-to-peer
              conversation with the world‚Äôs best engineers. Thus, half of the
              shows focus on advanced technical skills or methods, while the
              others focus on soft skills and/or topics tangentially related to
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              The audience's technical interests include, but are not limited
              to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue</li>
              <li> CSS libraries, frameworks</li>
              <li>GraphQL</li>
              <li>JavaScript utility libraries</li>
              <li>Server-side / universal JavaScript</li>
              <li>Graphics and Data viz (d3, canvas)</li>
              <li>
                Alternative syntax/supersets TypeScript, Flow, Reason, Elm
              </li>
              <li>Full stack engineering</li>
              <li>Build tooling and developer experience</li>
              <li>Software design patterns and methodologies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On the soft skills/culture side, the audience has an appetite for
              the following topics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Self-improvement & productivity</li>
              <li>Freelancing and running small businesses</li>
              <li>Engineering management and team building</li>
              <li>Tech culture</li>
              <li>Office life</li>
              <li>Remote work</li>
              <li>Marketing & passive income</li>
              <li>Work/life balance</li>
              <li>Fitness and nutrition</li>
              <li>
                Premium products ‚Äî Jared and Ken feature top ‚ÄúPicks‚Äù each
                episode which is a product or service they‚Äôve been enjoying
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What You‚Äôll Get &amp; Pricing</h2>
            <p>
              We have found that we get the best results for our advertisers
              when they sponsor at least three shows. Currently each sponsor
              spot is $1,000 USD per episode with a minimum of three episodes,
              though this price will increase as our audience does. Single show
              sponsorships are $1,200.
            </p>
            <p>As part of the sponsorship package, you'll get:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                A sponsorship section at the top of the episode show notes.
                These notes will be listed on both the Undefined.fm website as
                well as on each user's mobile device as they listen to the
                podcast. This is a great opportunity to list any coupon codes or
                unique links you'd like listeners to click on.
              </li>
              <li>
                {' '}
                A mention and single line at the top of the show. For example,
                Jared or Ken might say,{' '}
                <em>
                  This episode is sponsored by Clubhouse.io. It‚Äôs my new
                  favorite agile project management software; we switched from
                  Jira to Clubhouse around 3 months ago and haven‚Äôt looked back
                  and we‚Äôll talk about why partway through the show.

              <li>
                A 1-2 min sponsor spot midway during the episode. While we can
                do a regular ad read, we have found that having Ken or Jared
                talk about the product or service and their experience with it
                gives it authenticity. A thank-you tweet from{' '}

                with a link to your product or service from the show's Twitter
                account.
